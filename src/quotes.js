You have to be bold enough to make something from nothing over and over again. And you have to be delusional enough to think that your ideas are valuable, which is, of course, not delusional at all. The second: you have to build the ship to sail on. In other words, you can't tell people about the ship you are thinking about building and expect them to buy tickets for the first ride. Instead you must put in the work first. That often means heavy lifting, isolation, heaps of doubt, and epic failures and setbacks. It's a lonely place to be when you are building you ship. But when you do it and set sail, people will see how beautiful and majestic it is, and there will be a line to buy tickets. This can be applied to any creative endeavour, especially when you consider the better you build your ship, the longer you can sail before you have to make repairs and improvements.",
